    acidificationAccumulatedExceedanceAE:
      description: Acidification refers to the process where emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), and ammonia (NH₃) lead to the formation of acidic compounds in the atmosphere, which then deposit in soils and water bodies, reducing pH levels. This indicator measures the potential impact of these emissions on ecosystems, using an accumulated exceedance approach to assess how much ecosystems can tolerate before damage occurs.
